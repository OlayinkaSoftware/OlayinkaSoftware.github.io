										<h2><a href="#">My Experience So Far @ The Federal Polytechnic Ilaro<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/ilaro.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>My first time at The Federal Polytechnic Ilaro was in 2015 when I came to write my first POSTUTME Exam. <br>
										Unfortunately I was not given admission until the following year.</p>

									<p>I started my academic journey in the Federal Polytechnic Ilaro in the year 2016 as a National Diploma student in the school of Pure and Applied Sciences, Computer Science department.

										I have learnt a lot from different courses, coursemates and lecturers alike, especially in the area of technology.
									</p>
									<p>My experience so far has been amazing. I have learned and experienced so many new things in such a short period of time, and it has been so fast<br>
										I am still discovering all the opportunities that the Polytechnic have to offer me. FPI is a very welcoming citadel of knowledge<br>
										From my very first day, I felt at home. I have made many new friends from different backgrounds.
									</p>
									<p>My classes are great and I enjoy every one of them. The department and details of what we are learning have been far beyond my high school experience<br>
										It is just amazing to think that even the tiniest details on the subatomic level can have such a huge impact.
									</p>
									<p>Another experince is the school discipline and code of dressing and grooming for male and female students alike, it can be frustrating <br>
										at times, but it's always for the good of the students. Another things I aenjoy on campus is going to the gym. I try to go at least four times a week.
									</p>
									<p>Time has been flying by and its hard to believe that we have been on campus for months already. Lifeat FPI is a great experience that I plan to make the <br> 
										most out of.
									</p>
									<p>Thanks for your time</p>

										<h2><a href="#">My Undying Passion For Technology<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/tech.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Technology is a passion of mine and I enjoy nothing more than learning the trends that technology is taking in order to work more efficiently and see progress and success. 
										I love seeing the big picture mapped out for technology needs. Whether its cloud services, or the future needs of a department’s wireless technology. Efficiency is huge to me, 
										and I have a passion for finding new and more productive ways to reach goals. Mapping out the technological solutions for the future is an important way to ensure efficiency is 
										reached in every process possible.
									</p>
									<p>
										I’ve had a number of opportunities to have leadership principles taught to me as well as an ingrained work-ethic that is driven by placing myself and creating a well-structured work environment. 
										I have completed DiSC and Myers Briggs and I’m excited to continue to see how leadership development takes its place within a workplace. The different pieces created on a team are a vital part of 
										any organization and learning how piece fit within an organization is vital.
									</p>
									<p>I have learnt a lot from different lecturers from various departments at different stages of my time here, who all have given me through their wonderful way of teaching,
					                    the needed foundation to be successful in the world of Tech. All these have contributed immensely to my passion.
